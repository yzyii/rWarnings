# rWarnings

UI display of enemy ability / spell usage based off of https://github.com/ShiyoKozuki/CombatMessages and https://github.com/onimitch/ffxi-zonename

The primary difference between this and CombatMessages is that no targeting is required.

Up to 5 spells or abilities being cast or readied by enemys around you are displayed at any given time.

priority.lua contains spells or abilities that are highlighted a different colour to stand out from other generic actions and can be edited / added to.

/rwarnings prio can be used if you wish to display ONLY spell and abilities in priority.lua.
